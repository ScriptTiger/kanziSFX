# kanziSFX: Kanzi SelF-eXtracting archive
kanziSFX is a minimal Kanzi decompressor package to decompress an embedded Kanzi bit stream, with built-in support to also untar a compressed tar archive. So, the embedded Kanzi bit stream could contain either a single file of arbitrary type or a tar archive which will be both decompressed and unarchived.

To import kanziSFX into your project:  
`go get github.com/ScriptTiger/kanziSFX`  
Then just `import "github.com/ScriptTiger/kanziSFX"` and get started with using its functions.

Please refer to the dev package docs and reference implementation for more details and ideas on how to integrate kanziSFX into your project.

# Reference Implementation

Usage: `kanzisfx [options...]`
Argument                  | Description
--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 `-knz`                   | Output Kanzi bit stream
 `-o <file\|directory>`   | Destination file or directory
 `-info`                  | Show Kanzi bit stream info

`-` can be used in place of `<file>` to designate standard output as the destination, but cannot be used in place of a directory for extracting tar archives.

Without any arguments, the embedded Kanzi stream will be decompressed into the working directory to a file of the same name as the executable, except with the `.exe` or `.app` extension removed. Or, if the Kanzi stream contains a tar archive, the tar archive will be both decompressed and unarchived into a folder within the working directory of the same name as the executable, except with the `.exe` or `.app` extension removed. So, command-line usage is only optional and the end user can just execute the application as they would any other application for this default behavior.

# Appending a Kanzi archive to a kanziSFX executable
Compile a kanziSFX executable from source or download the latest pre-built release for the intended target system:  
https://github.com/ScriptTiger/kanziSFX/releases/latest

For appending a Kanzi archive to a kanziSFX executable, issue one of the following commands.

For Windows:
```
copy /b "kanziSFX.exe"+"file.knz" "MyKanziSFX.exe"
```

For Linux and Mac:
```
cat "kanziSFX" "file.knz" > "MyKanziSFX"
```
